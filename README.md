                       ############### Project Overview ############
                       
- For our project, we wanted to make a gif maker by inputting a series of images.
This code is pretty simple, because we are beginners to python and it can be cleaned up, because lot's
of the code is hardcoded. 


                          ############## Instructions ############
                          
- To run this program, make sure to have 8 images you would like to make into a gif.(It has to be 8, no moreno less!!!!)

- You first upload the images and then you have to make sure that they are named 
sequentially(ex: image1, image2..etc).

- Make sure that you are running python 3, because it wont run in python 2.

- When you run the program, its going to ask you for the name of the 8 images. make sure
to enter just the image name, dont add ".jpg" to it, because the program already does that for you. 
CORRECT Way to type in image name Ex: image....INCORRECT way to enter the image name Ex: image.jpg

- IMPORTANT!!! The images must be JPGS!!! Other forms will NOT work.

- If you decide to change images, make sure to refresh the program because the outputted image will be
of the previous messages, so refresh it for the effects to take place



               #################### Future Work #################################
               
- This project I feel, really gave us a better understanidng of python and how it works.
- I'm interested in exploring more projects regarding image manipulation like a photoshop program or something else.
